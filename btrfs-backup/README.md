btrfs-backup
============

Purpose
-------

**btrfs-backup** is a program that can be used to backup data from one
or multiple btrfs file systems. It relies on the btrfs(8) utility
program to perform its job and provides a very simple interface for
quick btrfs snapshot creation and transferal.

As for the btrfs file system itself, the unit of backup is a subvolume.
Creation of snapshots for subvolumes is performed on an on demand basis,
that is, only if new data is detected to be available on the respective
subvolume a new snapshot is taken.

The program reasons in terms of repositories. A repository is a
directory on a btrfs system which is used to contain the newly created
as well as already available snapshots. In terms of backup there are two
repositories involved: a source repository and a destination repository.
These repositories are kept in sync by performing an incremental
transfer of the files of a snapshot from the source to the destination.
On the destination repository, the snapshot will subsequently be
remanifested.


Examples
--------

Assuming the following directory layout where each of the directories is
a btrfs subvolume:                                                <br />
.                                                                 <br />
├── backup                                                        <br />
├── snapshots                                                     <br />
└── subvolume                                                     <br />

The idea is that 'snapshots' will be the source repository, 'backup'
will be the destination repository, and 'subvolume' is the btrfs
subvolume to backup.

### Backup
In order to create a backup, use the following command:

``$ btrfs-backup --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/``

The -s/--subvolume option can be supplied multiple times in order to
perform a backup of multiple subvolumes.

### Restore
To restore the latest snapshot for the given subvolume from the backup,
the following command can be used:

``$ btrfs-backup --restore --subvolume=subvolume/ backup/ snapshots/``

Alternatively, you can use the --reverse option to keep the order of the
source and destination repository that was used during backup (as
opposed to restoration). This option exists for convenience only, so
that not the entire command line has to be amended but rather two
options can be appended to convert a backup operation into a restore
operation.

```
$ btrfs-backup --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/ --restore
               --reverse
```

The above step for restoration assumes that the subvolume you initially
backed up got deleted. However, under certain circumstances it might be
the case that you only want to restore the snapshots (the read-only
subvolumes created below snapshots/ in the example above) as opposed to
the original subvolume (i.e., subvolume/ above). This behavior can be
achieved by means of the snapshots-only option, like so:

```
$ btrfs-backup --restore --snapshots-only
               --subvolume=subvolume/ backup/ snapshots/
```
