btrfs-backup
============

Purpose
-------

**btrfs-backup** is a program that can be used to backup data from one
or multiple btrfs file systems. It relies on the btrfs(8) utility
program to perform its job and provides a very simple interface for
quick btrfs snapshot creation and transferal.

As for the btrfs file system itself, the unit of backup is a subvolume.
Creation of snapshots for subvolumes is performed on an on demand basis,
that is, only if new data is detected to be available on the respective
subvolume a new snapshot is taken.

The program reasons in terms of repositories. A repository is a
directory on a btrfs system which is used to contain the newly created
as well as already available snapshots. In terms of backup there are two
repositories involved: a source repository and a destination repository.
These repositories are kept in sync by performing an incremental
transfer of the files of a snapshot from the source to the destination.
On the destination repository, the snapshot will subsequently be
remanifested.


Examples
--------

Assuming the following directory layout where each of the directories is
a btrfs subvolume:                                                <br />
.                                                                 <br />
├── backup                                                        <br />
├── snapshots                                                     <br />
└── subvolume                                                     <br />

The idea is that 'snapshots' will be the source repository, 'backup'
will be the destination repository, and 'subvolume' is the btrfs
subvolume to backup.

### Backup
In order to create a backup, use the following command:

``$ btrfs-backup backup --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/``

The -s/--subvolume option can be supplied multiple times in order to
perform a backup of multiple subvolumes.

Along with a backup old snapshots can also be deleted in an automated
fashion. The --keep-for option can be given and a duration specified
that defines the duration after which old snapshots are deleted. An
example invocation looks like this:

```
$ btrfs-backup backup --keep-for=1d
                      --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/
```

Using the above command, all snapshots older than one day will be purged
from the snapshots/ repository (the backup/ repository is left
untouched). Supported duration units are: seconds (S), minutes (M),
hours (H), days (d), weeks (w), months (m), and years (y).

Note that as a safety measure, the most recent snapshot cannot be
deleted using this option.

### Restore
To restore the latest snapshot for the given subvolume from the backup,
the following command can be used:

``$ btrfs-backup restore --subvolume=subvolume/ backup/ snapshots/``

Alternatively, you can use the --reverse option to keep the order of the
source and destination repository that was used during backup (as
opposed to restoration). This option exists for convenience only, so
that not the entire command line has to be amended but only one word
replaced and an option appended to convert a backup operation into a
restore operation.

```
$ btrfs-backup restore --reverse
                       --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/
```

The above step for restoration assumes that the subvolume you initially
backed up got deleted. However, under certain circumstances it might be
the case that you only want to restore the snapshots (the read-only
subvolumes created below snapshots/ in the example above) as opposed to
the original subvolume (i.e., subvolume/ above). This behavior can be
achieved by means of the snapshots-only option, like so:

```
$ btrfs-backup restore --snapshots-only
                       --subvolume=subvolume/ backup/ snapshots/
```

### Remote Execution
In many cases it is a requirement to backup a subvolume to a remote host
(or restore a subvolume from it). Mounting a remote btrfs file system
locally by means of, for instance, sshfs will not provide the ability to
use btrfs specific tools on it.
To that end, commands can be run on the remote host directly (provided
it offers an interface for command execution from the outside and that
is has the required btrfs tool suite installed). A typical example for
remote command execution is SSH. Using **btrfs-backup** on a remote host
by means of an SSH connection can be achieved with the --remote-cmd
option:

```
$ btrfs-backup backup --remote-cmd='/usr/bin/ssh server'
                      --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/
```

In this example, we assume that by invoking '/usr/bin/ssh server'
locally we can establish a connection to the remote server. The command
specified using the --remote-cmd option has to be given with the full
path. Furthermore, this command must accept the command to execute
remotely (that is, on the host named 'server' in our example above) as
its arguments. Note that backup/ in this case does not refer to a local
folder but rather one on the remote side.

There are certain cases (an SSH setup with ControlMaster mode enabled
and ControlPersist option set that establishes a new master connection
from within **btrfs-backup**, for instance) where performing a backup
takes longer than it should or appears to be stalled [1]. In such an
event the --no-read-stderr option can be useful. It works around this
issue with the downside of no error message but only exit codes being
available in the case of command failure.

### Filters
**btrfs-backup** supports the notion of filters to process the
serialized data stream of a subvolume or incremental changes. Using
filters it is possible to insert arbitrary commands into the
post-serialization and pre-deserialization process. This functionality
can be used to apply compression to the backup process, for example.

The program distinguishes between two filters: a send filter is applied
after serialization of data took place during a backup and a receive
filter takes effect before deserialization in a restore operation. Under
normal circumstances, both filters complement each other with the
receive filter reverting the changes made by the send filter.
An example usage is compression. In a compression scenario the send
filter could be used to compress the data stream and the receive filter
can decompress it again.

Filters can be specified by means of the --send-filter and --recv-filter
options. All filtering commands have to be specified with absolute paths
to the script or binary to invoke as a filter. Multiple filters can be
specified by supplying multiple options. The order in which each of the
send and receive filters is applied equals the order in which the
respective options were given. A sample invocation using gzip and bzip2
for compression and decompression could look like this:

```
$ btrfs-backup backup --send-filter='/bin/gzip --stdout'
                      --send-filter='/bin/bzip2 --stdout --compress'
                      --recv-filter='/bin/bzip2 --decompress'
                      --recv-filter='/bin/gzip --decompress'
                      --subvolume=subvolume/ snapshots/ backup/
```

Note that this example is designed to illustrate usage of the filter
options. In a production scenario one would not apply two compression
methods on top of each other. Also, compression is used as an
illustrative example here. Other uses can be thought of (replication and
encryption, for instance). Arguably, compression of the binary data
stream might not result in much savings of bandwidth since it is
reasonable to believe that the btrfs program already creates a
sufficiently compressed stream of data.
Note furthermore that since filters are sensitive to ordering, they have
to be reordered for the restore case unless the --reverse option
(explained above) is used.
Lastly, note that filtering can be combined with remote command
execution as one would naively expect.

[1] For the technically interested person: the reason the program
    appears stalled is because in order to provide reasonable error
    messages, **btrfs-backup** reads data from stderr. In the SSH
    example with ControlPersist set, when SSH is started and creates a
    new master connection it will fork a second instance into the
    background that keeps the master connection open. However, because
    it does not close stderr, **btrfs-backup** waits until the process
    terminates, i.e., the master connection is shut down. For that
    matter, each SSH command issued exhibits a delay equal to the
    ControlPersist setting.
