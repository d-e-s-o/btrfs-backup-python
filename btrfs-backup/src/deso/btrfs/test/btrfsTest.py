"""Utility functionality for testing btrfs related functionality.

  This module provides the basic scaffolding for testing btrfs related
  changes. It contains classes that aid in creating loop back devices,
  formatting them with btrfs along with mounting them in the file
  system, and more.
  It furthermore makes ready-to-use test case base classes available
  that contain well defined execution environments.
