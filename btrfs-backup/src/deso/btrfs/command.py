"""Functions for creating btrfs commands ready for execution.

  In order to perform btrfs related actions we interface with the
  btrfs(8) command. This command provides the necessary functionality we
  require throughout the program, e.g., for creating and deleting
  subvolumes (only used for testing), listing, creating and deleting
  snapshots, sending and receiving them, and more.
